# openventilator

Welcome to the openventilator wiki!

Based on the information given by Jeremias Almada we are developing an OpenSource Ventilator for the Covid-19 Crisis.

The idea is to provide a reliable source of ventilation for people in dificult economical situations. 
The parts are made to be easilly found, thechnical features are still being decided, the ventilator has not being validated yet.

This initiative was taken by Jeremias who I Contacted for information on the project and that asked me on a way of making the project OpenSource.
